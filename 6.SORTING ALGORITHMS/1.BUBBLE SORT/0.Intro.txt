/======================= Bubble Sort (Easy Explanation & Note) =======================================================/
ðŸ”¹ What is Bubble Sort?
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.

ðŸ”¹ How does it work?
    â€¢ Start from the first element and compare it with the next element.
    â€¢ If the first element is greater, swap them.
    â€¢ Move to the next pair and repeat.
    â€¢ The largest number moves to the end after one complete pass.
    â€¢ Repeat the process for the remaining elements until sorted.

ðŸ”¹ Dry Run Example (Step-by-Step):-
    Array: [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]
    
    Pass 1:-
    [5, 3, 8, 4, 2] â†’ Compare 5 & 3 â†’ Swap â†’ [3, 5, 8, 4, 2]  
    [3, 5, 8, 4, 2] â†’ Compare 5 & 8 â†’ No swap  
    [3, 5, 8, 4, 2] â†’ Compare 8 & 4 â†’ Swap â†’ [3, 5, 4, 8, 2]  
    [3, 5, 4, 8, 2] â†’ Compare 8 & 2 â†’ Swap â†’ [3, 5, 4, 2, 8] âœ… (Largest element at the end)

    Pass 2:-
    [3, 5, 4, 2, 8] â†’ Compare 3 & 5 â†’ No swap  
    [3, 5, 4, 2, 8] â†’ Compare 5 & 4 â†’ Swap â†’ [3, 4, 5, 2, 8]  
    [3, 4, 5, 2, 8] â†’ Compare 5 & 2 â†’ Swap â†’ [3, 4, 2, 5, 8] âœ…

    Pass 3:-
    [3, 4, 2, 5, 8] â†’ Compare 3 & 4 â†’ No swap  
    [3, 4, 2, 5, 8] â†’ Compare 4 & 2 â†’ Swap â†’ [3, 2, 4, 5, 8] âœ…

    Pass 4:-
    [3, 2, 4, 5, 8] â†’ Compare 3 & 2 â†’ Swap â†’ [2, 3, 4, 5, 8] âœ… Sorted!

ðŸ”¹Time Complexity of Bubble Sort:-
    Case	                        Complexity
    Best Case (Already Sorted)	    O(n)
    Worst Case (Reverse Sorted)	    O(nÂ²)
    Average Case	                O(nÂ²)
    
ðŸ”¹Why is it called "Bubble Sort"?
    Because larger elements "bubble up" to the top after each pass, just like air bubbles rising in water.
    
ðŸ”¹Key Takeaways:-
âœ… Bubble Sort is simple but slow (O(nÂ²)).
âœ… Better alternatives: Insertion Sort (for small data), Quick Sort, Merge Sort (for large data).
âœ… Optimized Bubble Sort stops early when no swaps happen.
