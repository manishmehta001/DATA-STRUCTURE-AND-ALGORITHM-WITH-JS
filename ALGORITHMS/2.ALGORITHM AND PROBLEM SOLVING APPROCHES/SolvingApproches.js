/*Algorithm and problem solving approach
An Algorithm is a process or a set of steps to complete a task.
UCBSR

How To solve a problem:
(A). Devise a plan for solving the problem --> break the problem down to small steps and reach slowly towards completing
 the task.
	• Step 1- Understand The Problem
	• Step 2- Explore Concrete Examples (try with smaller inputs)
	• Step 3 - Break the steps down
	• Step 4 - Solve/Simplify the problem
	• Step 5- Look Back and Refactor --> improve the code try to minimize the code.
(B). Master common problem solving patterns

Understanding The Problem
	• Restate the problem in your own words --> write what you understand
	• What are the inputs that go into the problems?
	• What are the outputs that come out of the problem
	• Can the outputs be determined form the inputs --> Figure out this while restating the problem or while writing the
     solution.
	• Correctly labeling the data which will help me reach the output.
	
Explore Concrete Problems
Working out with examples will not only help understand the problems better it will also determine if we solved the 
problem correctly. As the code's output and our worked out examples output should match.

	• Start with simple examples
	• Progress to more complex examples ->> hH, "12" 12,
	• Explore examples with empty and wrong inputs.
	
Breaking Down The Problem
This helps lay out the steps. It Also helps in figuring out pieces of the problem which I might still not have 
understood.

Solve Or simplify The Problem
Solve the problem if you can else make the problem simpler meaning not changing the problem entirely but taking one 
piece of the problem at a time or omitting one or two simple details of the problem to find how the problem can be 
solved.
	• Simplify: Find the most difficult part which is making it hard to solve the problem. Delete that difficult part 
    and move ahead. Once the restated problem is done try to put the difficult part back into the problem.

Look Back and Refactor

Even if the solution is working try to improve the solution:
Questions to ask Self while Refactoring:
	• Can you check the result
	• Is there a way to get the result with a different approach
	• Is the solution readable, can it be understood easily
	• Can this solution be applied to a different problem
	• Can the Big O be improved f the solution
	• Think of other ways to refactor
	• See other solution
