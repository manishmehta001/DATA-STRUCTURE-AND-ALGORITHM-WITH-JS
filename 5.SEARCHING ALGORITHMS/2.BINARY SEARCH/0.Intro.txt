/======================Binary Search===========================/
Algorithm:
    • Binary search is a more efficient algorithm, but it only works on sorted arrays or lists.
Steps:
Find the middle element.
    • If the middle element is equal to the target, return the index.
    • If the target is smaller than the middle element, repeat the process on the left half.
    • If the target is larger, repeat on the right half.
    • Keep repeating until you either find the element or the list is exhausted.

Use Case:
    • Works only on sorted data. It's faster for large datasets compared to linear search.

Time Complexity:
    • Best case: O(1)
    • Worst case: O(log n) (because you halve the search space with each comparison)

Dry Run Example: Array: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], Target: 40

Step-by-step:
    • Middle element is 30 (index 2).
    • 40 is greater than 30, so now search in the right half [40, 50].
    • Middle element is 40 (index 3).
    • Found it! Return index 3.
