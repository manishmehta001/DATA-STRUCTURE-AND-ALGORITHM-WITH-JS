/*Dry Run Example
Array: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70], Target: 40

Step 1

low = 0, high = 6
mid1 = 0 + (6 - 0) / 3 = 2 â†’ arr[mid1] = 30
mid2 = 6 - (6 - 0) / 3 = 4 â†’ arr[mid2] = 50
40 lies between mid1 and mid2, so search in [30, 40, 50].
Step 2

low = 3, high = 3
mid1 = mid2 = 3, arr[3] = 40
Target found at index 3! âœ…
Time Complexity Analysis

Best Case: 
    O(1) (if the element is found immediately)

Worst Case: O(log_3 n) (logarithmic complexity but with base 3 instead of 2)
Comparison with Binary Search:
    Binary search splits the array into 2 parts â†’ O(log 2 n).
    Ternary search splits the array into 3 parts â†’ O(log 3 n).
    Binary search generally performs better due to fewer comparisons.

Use Case
    Works best for sorted arrays.
    Used when the cost of comparisons is very high (e.g., disk-based searching).
    In most cases, binary search is preferred because it requires fewer comparisons.
    ðŸš€ Ternary Search is an alternative to Binary Search but is less efficient in most cases! */
