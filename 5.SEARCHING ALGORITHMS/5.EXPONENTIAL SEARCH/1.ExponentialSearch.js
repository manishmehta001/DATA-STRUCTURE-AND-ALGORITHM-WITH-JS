/*
Explanation (Step-by-Step)
Find a Range Using Exponential Growth

Start with i = 1, then i = 2, 4, 8, ... until arr[i] is greater than or equal to the target.
Example:
i = 1 â†’ arr[1] = 20
i = 2 â†’ arr[2] = 30
i = 4 â†’ arr[4] = 50 (greater than 40).
Perform Binary Search in the Found Range

We now apply binary search between indices 2 and 4 (since arr[4] > 40).
Find 40 at index 3.

Time Complexity Analysis
Best Case: 
    O(1) (if the target is the first element).

Worst Case: 
    O(logn) (due to the combination of exponential growth and binary search).

Use Case:
Best for searching in unbounded or very large sorted datasets where the size isn't known beforehand (e.g., searching in infinite streams or large databases). ðŸš€
