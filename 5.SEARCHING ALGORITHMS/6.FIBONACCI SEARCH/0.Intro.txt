/=================================== Fibonacci Search ==========================================/

Algorithm:
    • Fibonacci search is similar to binary search but uses Fibonacci numbers to split the array.

Steps:
    • Calculate two Fibonacci numbers F(k-1) and F(k-2) that are less than or equal to the length of the array.
    • Compare the target element with the element at the index corresponding to Fibonacci numbers.
    • Narrow down the search based on comparisons.

Use Case:
    • Used in sorted arrays, especially if you want to use Fibonacci sequence properties.

Time Complexity:
    •Best case: O(1)
    •Worst case: O(log n)

Dry Run Example: Array: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],Target: 40
    • Fibonacci numbers: F(5) = 5, F(4) = 3

Step-by-step:
    • Compare 40 with element at index 3 (40).
    • Found it at index 3.
