1. Linear Search

    Algorithm=>
    • Linear search is the simplest searching algorithm. In this algorithm, we search for a particular element by checking each element of the array or list one by one.

Steps=>
    • Start from the first element.
    • Compare it with the target element.
    • If it's a match, return the index.
    • If not, move to the next element and repeat until you find the element or reach the end of the list.

Use Case:-
    • Useful when the data is unsorted, or when you don’t know if the data is sorted.

Time Complexity:-
    • Best case: O(1) (when the element is at the start)
    • Worst case: O(n) (when the element is at the end or not found)


Dry Run Example: Let’s take an array: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],Target: 40

Step-by-step:-
    • Start from 10 → not equal to 40.
    • Move to 20 → not equal to 40.
    • Move to 30 → not equal to 40.
    • Move to 40 → match found! Return the index 3.
